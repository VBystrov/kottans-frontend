## 1. Git and GitHub

I work with GIT earlier using GUI extensions Visual Studio Code, so I was familiar with the topics. 
Still, in this section I learned some GIT commands.
Not sure whether I will use them in my work every day or not, but I think its useful to know them.

Show all branches graph: ` git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all `

## 2. Linux CLI and Networking

I dont use Linux, so this material was completely new for me, except commands that is the same in Windows. Most interesting for me was disc partition.

Useful things: 
 - slash "/" at the start path is root, path without - relative
 - ~ - home directory
 - r w x - read write execute, user - group - world
 - \> - overwrite, >> - append
 - | - sends the output of a command as the input to another command

Main commands:

- `ls` - show content of folder
- `mkdir` - create directory
- `mv` - move file or rename
- `more` - Display the contents of a file
- `cd` - change directory
- `pwd` - print working directory

- `rm` - remove file
- `rmdir` - remove folder
