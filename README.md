### 1. Git and GitHub

I work with GIT earlier using GUI extensions Visual Studio Code, so I was familiar with the topics. 
Still, in this section I learned some GIT commands.
Not sure whether I will use them in my work every day or not, but I think its useful to know them.

Show all branches graph: ` git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all `
